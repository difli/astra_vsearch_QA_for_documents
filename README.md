# astra_vsearch_QA_for_documents

This demo guides you through setting up Astra DB with Vector Search, Cassio and Open AI to implement an generative Q&A for your own Documentation

Jupyter notebook for generative Q&A for douments is powered by Astra Vector Search and OpenAI [(https://github.com/openai/) and Casssio [Opensource LLM integration with Cassandra and Astra DB (https://cassio.org/)].

# Astra Vector Search
Astra vector search enables developers to search a database by context or meaning rather than keywords or literal values. This is done by using “embeddings”. Embeddings are a type of representation used in machine learning where high-dimensional or complex data is mapped onto vectors in a lower-dimensional space. These vectors capture the semantic properties of the input data, meaning that similar data points have similar embeddings.

# CassIO
CassIO is the ultimate solution for seamlessly integrating Apache Cassandra® with generative artificial intelligence and other machine learning workloads. This powerful Python library simplifies the complicated process of accessing the advanced features of the Cassandra database, including vector search capabilities. With CassIO, developers can fully concentrate on designing and perfecting their AI systems without any concerns regarding the complexities of integration with Cassandra.

# OpenAI
OpenAI provides various tools and resources to implement your own Document QA Search system. This includes pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5, which can understand and generate human-like text. Additionally, OpenAI offers guidelines and APIs to leverage their models for document search and question-answering tasks, enabling developers to build powerful and intelligent Document QA Search applications.
