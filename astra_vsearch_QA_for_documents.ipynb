    "This demo guides you through setting up Astra DB with Vector Search, Cassio and Open AI to implement an generative Q&A for your own Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook for generative Q&A for douments is powered by [Astra Vector Search](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/overview.html) and [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/) and Casssio [Opensource LLM integration with Cassandra and Astra DB](https://cassio.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Astra Vector Search\n",
    "Astra vector search enables developers to search a database by context or meaning rather than keywords or literal values. This is done by using “embeddings”. Embeddings are a type of representation used in machine learning where high-dimensional or complex data is mapped onto vectors in a lower-dimensional space. These vectors capture the semantic properties of the input data, meaning that similar data points have similar embeddings.\n",
    "Reference: [Astra Vector Search](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## CassIO\n",
    "CassIO is the ultimate solution for seamlessly integrating Apache Cassandra® with generative artificial intelligence and other machine learning workloads. This powerful Python library simplifies the complicated process of accessing the advanced features of the Cassandra database, including vector search capabilities. With CassIO, developers can fully concentrate on designing and perfecting their AI systems without any concerns regarding the complexities of integration with Cassandra.\n",
    "Reference [Cassio](https://cassio.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenAI\n",
    "OpenAI provides various tools and resources to implement your own Document QA Search system. This includes pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5, which can understand and generate human-like text. Additionally, OpenAI offers guidelines and APIs to leverage their models for document search and question-answering tasks, enabling developers to build powerful and intelligent Document QA Search applications.\n",
    "Reference: [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo Summary\n",
    "ChatGPT excels at answering questions, but only on topics it remembers from its training data. It offers you a nice dialog interface to ask questions and get answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what do you do when you have your onw documents? How can you leverage the GenAI and LLM models to get insights in those?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an Q/A Bot that you want to provide to your customers for asking questions against the documentation of your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beeing able to do so, you have to implement your own ChatGPT-like solution.\n",
    "The implementation requires\n",
    "1. Analysing your existing documents and store the information\n",
    "2. Providing search capabilities for your questions to get answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is solve by using a LLM models. Ideally you embedd the data as vectors and store them in a vector database and then use the LLM models on top of that database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference on your onw documentations based on Astra DB vector search.\n",
